# Gifty
Gifty is a completely free and open source gift exchange tool for Android
modeled after the age-old tradition of drawing names from a bowl. Start the
application, enter the names of the participants, and pass the device around
while everyone is randomly assigned to each other.

Gifty is available on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.stevenortiz.gifty).
