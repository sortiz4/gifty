# Gifty
Gifty is a mobile application that modernizes the traditional gift exchange
experience by digitizing the classic names-in-a-bowl approach. Gifty allows
users to enter participant names and then pass the device around the room as
each person is randomly assigned a gift recipient, maintaining the element of
surprise while eliminating the need for paper slips.
